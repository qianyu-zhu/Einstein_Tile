# Einstein_Tile

## Introduction
An aperiodic monotile (or an [einstein tile](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/newfound-mathematical-einstein-shape-creates-a-never-repeating-pattern/)) is a shape that tiles the plane, but never periodically. [This paper](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/03/24/the-hat-a-single-shape-that-can-tile-the-plane-aperiodically-but-not-periodically/) presents the first true aperiodic monotile, a shape that forces aperiodicity through geometry alone, with no additional constraints applied via matching conditions. The Authors prove that this shape, a polykite that we call “the hat”, must assemble into tilings based on a substitution system.

I make this repository to construct patches of aperiodic hat tiles. The construction is based on the self-similarity of the einstein tiling. It contains:
- A commented colab notebook,
- A galary of colored Einstein Tiling.
